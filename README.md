# Beating the Bubble

Final project for CS 221 (Spring 2018) by Jesus Cervantes, Alex Kim, and Alexandre Bucquet.

This project aims to predict house prices from the [Ames Housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) using various machine learning techniques. For a complete report, please view our **[final report](reports/final-report.pdf)** and **[poster](reports/poster.pdf)**.

## Key Techniques

Some techniques we used were used were gradient boosting, weight regularization, and k-means clustering. All mechanisms were coded from scratch using numpy and pandas, allowing us to gain a deeper intuition. For more details on our techniques and their results, please view our [final report](reports/final-report.pdf).
