# Beating the Bubble: Predicting House Prices in Ames, IA

Final project for CS 221 (Spring 2018) by Jesus Cervantes, Alex Kim, and Alexandre Bucquet.

This project aims to predict house prices from the [Ames Housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) using various machine learning techniques.

For a complete report, please view our [final report](reports/final-report.pdf) and [poster](reports/poster.pdf).

## Key Techniques

Some techniques we used were used were gradient boosting, weight regularization, and k-means clustering. Although these techniques are fairly elementary, we hope to gain a deeper inutition by coding them from the ground up.
